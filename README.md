What is GHex
============

GHex is a hex editor for the GNOME desktop.

GHex can load raw data from binary files and display them for editing in the
traditional hex editor view. The display is split in two columns, with
hexadecimal values in one column and the ASCII representation in the other.
A useful tool for working with raw data.


System Requirements
===================

GHex should build on (I guess) most unices. It needs the X11R6 libraries,
glib, gdk and gtk 1.2.x libraries and GNOME 1.0.x libraries.
